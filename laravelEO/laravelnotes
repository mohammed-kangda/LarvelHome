# LEARNING REF:

Eloquent: Getting Started (https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent,Learnvern,Geekyshows)

It is used For Minimum data.

# IMP COMMANDS:

Eloquent and QB can also be used combinely.

-->create model with migration  :
php artisan make:model Student --migration

-->or model with migration and controller php artisan make:model Student -mc 

-->creating only model
php artisan make:model ModelName
    
Model is used for interaction with db.

Like query builder we have to just write model name ahead

It follows snake case eg: product_car as ProductCar 

php artisan db:seed --class=AdminSeeder     used for specific seeding


# Larvel - ONE TO ONE REALATIONSHIP (hasOne)

prevents us from writing joins queries
EG:
  if we have cust & order table and we have to want detail of cust and order details so EO -> cust_id wil be foreign from order tbl

php artisan make:model modelName --all

it creates:
  model,factory,migration,seeder,request,controller,policy
2 table = 2 model
2 seeder
1 controller
2 migrations

But we want single brand details with respected single dealers details is an EG of ONE TO ONE REALATIONSHIP

in migration creating table in up()
without faker also we can geneerate fake data

if we have diff colname and foreign key is not established then
return $this->hasOne(dealers::class,foreignKey:'',localKey:'');

EG:

b_id  | Name          d_id  |  b_id   | Name  
                       
1     |  A             1    |   1     |   x 
2     |  B             2    |   2     |   c
3     |  C             3    |   3     |   v
